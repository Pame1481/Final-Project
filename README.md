# Final-Project -- > Housing Data 3.0

We took multiple variations of Zillow housing data.  
Based on our needs we used the Housing ETL Juypter notebook to clean and reshape the data.  
The pandas Melt function was critical in our cleaning needs- as the dates were columns when we needed them as features in rows. 
 Also the Housing ETL was used to remap the neighborhoods to the y_test and predicted values for our Random Forest model.  
 Files cleaned new_housing and final predictions.
